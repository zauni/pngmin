> Grunt plugin to compress png images with pngquant.

## Getting Started

This plugin requires Grunt `>=1.0.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-pngmin --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks("grunt-pngmin");
```

Windows, Linux and Mac OSX is supported out of the box.

## The "pngmin" task

### Overview

In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `pngmin` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  pngmin: {
    options: {
      // Task-specific options go here.
    },
    your_target: {
      // Target-specific file lists and/or options go here.
    },
  },
});
```

### Options

#### options.concurrency

Type: `Number`
Default value: `4`

How many executables will be spawned in parallel.

#### options.ext

Type: `String`
Default value: `'-fs8.png'`

The file extension after the quantization.

#### options.quality

Type: `String`, `Object` or `Array`
Default value: `null`

Instructs pngquant to use the least amount of colors required to meet or exceed the max quality.
If conversion results in quality below the min quality the image won't be saved.
Specify quality like that:

- String: `'min-max'`
- Object: `{min: min, max: max}`
- Array: `[min, max]`

min and max are numbers in range 0 (worst) to 100 (perfect), similar to JPEG.
For example as object: `{min: 60, max: 80}`.

#### options.force

Type: `Boolean`
Default value: `false`

Should existing files be overwritten by the optimized version? Be careful with this option if you need the original files!

#### options.speed

Type: `Number`
Default value: `3`

Speed/quality trade-off from 1 (brute-force) to 10 (fastest). Speed 10 has 5% lower quality, but is 8 times faster than the default.

#### options.iebug

Type: `Boolean`
Default value: `false`

Workaround for IE6, which only displays fully opaque pixels. pngquant will make almost-opaque pixels fully opaque and will avoid creating new transparent colors.

#### options.binary

Type: `String`
Default value: `'pngquant'` in your `PATH` or `'bin/pngquant'`

This option is just for users where the pngquant-bin package could not be installed correctly. Normally you don't need this!
The pngquant executable which will be spawned. If the pngquant binary is not found in `PATH` the default fallback is `'bin/pngquant'`, but this option has always precedence.

#### options.retry

Type: `Boolean`
Default value: `true`

If pngquant exits with status 99 (ie it was not able to compress with the specified quality option), allow pngmin to try again without quality option.

#### options.nofs

Type: `Boolean`
Default value: `false`

If `nofs` is set to `true` the Floyd-Steinberg dithering will be disabled.

#### options.failOnError

Type: `Boolean`
Default value: `true`

Causes the `grunt` command to also fail in case an error is encountered. For details, just add `--stack` to your `grunt` command.


### Usage Examples

#### Default Options

In this example `image.png` will be optimized, copied to `dest` folder and renamed to `image-fs8.png`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  pngmin: {
    compile: {
      options: {},
      files: [
        {
          src: "path/to/image.png",
          dest: "dest/",
        },
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

#### Custom Options

In this example `image.png` will be optimized and copied to `dest` folder.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  pngmin: {
    compile: {
      options: {
        ext: ".png",
      },
      files: [
        {
          src: "path/to/image.png",
          dest: "dest/",
        },
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

In this example `image.png` gets overwritten by the optimized version, so use force option carefully!

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  pngmin: {
    compile: {
      options: {
        ext: ".png",
        force: true,
      },
      files: [
        {
          src: "path/to/image.png",
          dest: "path/to/",
        },
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

#### Example which is preserving the subfolder structure

In this example all images in the folder `path/to/images/` and its subfolders will be optimized and copied to `dest` while preserving the directory structure.
See http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#building-the-files-object-dynamically for more options.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  pngmin: {
    compile: {
      options: {
        ext: ".png",
      },
      files: [
        {
          expand: true, // required option
          src: ["**/*.png"],
          cwd: "path/to/images/", // required option
          dest: "dest/",
        },
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

#### Complex example

This is a complex example with a lot of options set:

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  pngmin: {
    compile: {
      options: {
        concurrency: 8, // specify how many exucutables get spawned in parallel
        ext: ".png", // use .png as extension for the optimized files
        quality: "65-80", // output quality should be between 65 and 80 like jpeg quality
        speed: 10, // pngquant should be as fast as possible
        iebug: true, // optimize image for use in Internet Explorer 6
        nofs: true, // disable dithering
      },
      files: [
        {
          src: "path/to/images/*.png",
          dest: "dest/",
        },
        {
          src: "path/to/other/images/*.png",
          dest: "another/dest/",
        },
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

## Contributing

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code.

When writing unit tests, perform the following:

1. Ensure you've got [`Node 20+`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) setup and installed.
1. Run install: `npm install`
1. Run tests: `npm run test`
